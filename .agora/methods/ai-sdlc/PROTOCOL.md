# AI-SDLC 0.2.0 protocol

The operating pattern remains: **plan -> clarify -> human decision -> execute -> validate**. AI drafts a plan from the Intent and proposes the next refinement; humans validate meaningful decisions before execution. By contract, no phase advances without its gate.

## Phases

| Phase | Base roles | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inception | product-owner, developer | clarify Intent; validate Level 1 Plan, Stories/criteria, NFRs, risks, Measurement Criteria, Units and suggested Bolts |
| construction | developer | Domain Design -> Logical Design -> implementation/tests -> Deployment Unit, with brownfield semantic elevation first when needed |
| operations | developer, product-owner | deploy, observe, remediate through governed decisions and accept the revision |
| completed | product-owner | terminal Agora record of accepted work |

## Forward gates

- `inception-approved`: Inception to Construction.
- `construction-verified`: Construction to Operations.
- `completion`: Operations to completed.

## Rework

- `construction -> inception`
- `operations -> construction`

Rework transitions are deliberately ungated in this candidate pack. Core records the transition history durably; higher-assurance profiles may add evidence/policy obligations outside the base method.

## Flavor capabilities used by this pack

The method gate requires Level 1 `plan` and `bolt-plan` artifact kinds. Recursive plan validation, adaptive pathway selection, executable Bolt semantics, Context Graph traceability and the continuous wizard are implemented by the AI-SDLC flavor around this Core Method Pack. They enrich execution without changing the three canonical phase names.


## Core artifact semantics

- An **Intent** states the outcome to achieve.
- A **Unit of Work** is a bounded slice of cohesive value derived from the Intent.
- **Bolts** are short hours/days build-validation iterations over a Unit; they may be sequential or parallel.
- The Level 1 Plan is progressively decomposed while preserving human validation and traceability.
- Persisted artifacts form context memory for later steps.


## Governance behavior

Fail closed when a gate reports missing evidence or missing approval. Agora Core remains authoritative for lifecycle state and the wizard may explain blockers but cannot fabricate their satisfaction.
